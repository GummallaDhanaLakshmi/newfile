            <p>As an appetiser or starter, Chicken 65 is a hot, deep-fried chicken dish from Chennai, where it all began. Red chillies are responsible for the dishâ€™s flavour. However, the actual ingredients in the recipe can change. It is typically served with an onion and lemon 
                garnish and is made with boneless chicken. This is a must-have at every party with a non-veg appetiser menu.</p>

        <p>Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish including layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, 
            giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy.</p>
