        <h2>MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <P>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</P>
        <P>Mobile app development is the act or process by which a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app"> mobile app</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development">developed</a> one or more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device">mobile devices</a> which can 
            include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant"> personal digital assistants </a>s(PDA), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_data_terminal">enterprise digital assistants</a> (EDA), or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone">mobile phones.[1]</a> Such software applications are 
            specifically designed to run on mobile devices, taking numerous hardware constraints into consideration. Common constraints include 
            CPU architecture and speeds, available memory (RAM), limited data storage capacities, and considerable variation in displays
             (technology, size, dimensions, resolution) and input methods (buttons, keyboards, touch screens with or without styluses).[2] These
              applications (or 'apps') can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_(computer_programs)">pre-installed </a> phones during manufacturing or delivered as web applications, using server-side or
               client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"> web browser.[3]</a></P>
               <br>
               <p>A web browser is not the same thing as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine">search engine</a>, though the two are often confused.[3][4]
                 A search engine is a website that provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">links</a> to other websites. However, to connect to a
                  website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.[5] In some 
                  technical contexts, browsers are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent">user agents</a>.</p>
